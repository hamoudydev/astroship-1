      To the Dearborn/Heights community:
      <br><br>
      Last year, our community spent a whopping $75 million on food delivery apps. But here's the catch – a staggering $9 million left our local economy as fees and commissions paid to companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and GrubHub. That's money slipping through our fingers and into the pockets of out-of-state corporations.
      <br><br>
      🏡 It's time to keep our dollars close to home! 🏡
      <br><br>
      Dearborn Eats is a homegrown food delivery marketplace dedicated to our community. 
      <br><br>
      🌟 Our mission? To ensure every single dollar stays right here in Dearborn/Heights, where it belongs.
      <br><br>
      🍽️ Imagine a platform where every local restaurant joins forces, ditching the big players. 🍽️
      <br><br>
      What's in it for everyone? 🤝
      <br>
      <br>✅ Restaurant owners pay lower commissions.
      <br>✅ Drivers earn more with gas, car, and insurance stipends.
      <br>✅ Eaters enjoy lower prices. 🤩
      <br><br>
      And here's the icing on the cake – complete transparency! You'll be able to see where the revenue dollars go. Our aim is to operate as a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/">B-Corp</a> which makes us responsible to the benefit of the community.
      <br><br>
      🚀 But here's where I need your help, dear community. 🚀
      <br><br>
      I'm on the lookout for visionary restaurant owners who share our dream. We're starting with 10 restaurants to kickstart this exciting journey!
      <br><br>
      Are you in? Let's make a difference together!
